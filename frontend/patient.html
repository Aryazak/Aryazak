                <h2>What is Telemedicine?</h2>
                <p>Telemedicine is a modern approach to healthcare, allowing patients to receive medical care remotely. Through video calls, phone consultations, or messaging, patients can connect with healthcare professionals without the need for an in-person visit. This service helps reduce wait times, increases accessibility, and provides convenience for individuals unable to attend traditional appointments due to distance or time constraints.</p>
